# Transcribe-

A simple single-page tool to transcribe video or audio files using OpenAI's speech API.

Open `index.html` in a browser, paste your API key, choose your file, select a language (or use Auto) and click **Transcribe**. The app uses the `gpt-4o-transcribe` model with word-level timestamps and speaker diarization. When done a text file of the transcript can be downloaded.
